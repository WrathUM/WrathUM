Hi, I am a current student at the University of Michigan, studying Computer Science and statistics. I have included a couple small python coding challenges that I did for fun.

I also have a private repository containing all of my school projects as we are not allowed to publically display the code to prevent honor code violations. 
Private copies can be provided if you are an employerer and are interested in seeing how I code and or problem solve!
